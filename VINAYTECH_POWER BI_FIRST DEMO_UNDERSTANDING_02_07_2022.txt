Today Live Practice Session For Small Project
Data:	
	Anything you are able to store is called data.
	We have three types of data 
	a) Structured Data: Data in the form of tables / sheets [column by column format]
			Ex: Excel Data, Table Data...
	b) Semi-Structured data: Data not fully structured.
			Ex: Log info, Event Viewer, Audit info...

			Text files, JSON Files, XML files etc.
	c) Unstructured data:
			Social media [facebook,twitter, insta...]
			Docs [pdf, word doc...]
			Satellite Signals, Robotic Process Instructions
			etc...
Data Handling IT applications:
	Two types
	a) Business running applications and store [OLTP: Online Transaction Processing]
		
		Ex: Irctc, Bookmyshow...

		You booked a train ticket( Web, Desktop, Apps)..structured application...
		Data storage structured
		PNR NO, no of passengers, start station, end station, amount,etc. [Databases]
		12313,2,hyd,mum,4500
		23131,che,kol, 9000
		Transaction successful / Failed

	b) Business analysis applications and report[OLAP: Online Analytical Processing]

		Which train having highest demand?
		Which region having good demand of trains?
		Trains having full booking in first 3 minutes..

		Note: This data also called as "Decision Making Data/Analytical Data / BI Data"

		Normal Data-------BI Process--------> Decision Making / BI Data

		Data--> Extract-->Transform-->Load--> Storage->Meaningful data[with aggregates]-->Present [reports
			and dashboards] in visuals--> BI Data


		Visual: Which displays data / data+graphical object
		Report:
			Set of visuals [any type]
			Defined for single individual operation [Cash withdraw report, Cash Deposit report]
			More data and more visuals 
		Dashboard:
			Set of visuals [simple and cute]: KPI visuals [Key Performance Indicator]
			Designed for a subject area operation[multiple individuals reports information]
			Ex: Savings account deposits, withdrawals etc... single area
			
	BI: Business Intelligence: Intelligence to the business. Decision Making to the business.
	
		1990's approach and tools : Legay process
		Multiple tools, setups, resources required.

		2000-2010: MSBI and Few more companies given end-end BI implementation in multiple tools / processes.

		MSBI: [First BI from Microsoft]
			Microsoft Business Intelligence / SQL Server Business Intelligence
			Announced: 2005
			Market Leader: 2008 onwards
			Versions: 2005, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017,2019,2022
		
		Why Power BI? Why the name is Power BI?
			MSBI Drawbacks:
			a) Semi-unstructured data handling is less [not available]
			b) Not cloud friendly 
			c) Not mobile friendly 
			d) Bigdata / Data Science / AI no support
			etc...

		Power BI:
			"Powering BI"
			"Adding Power to BI"
			
			a) Semi-unstructured data handling is possible 
			b) Full cloud friendly 
			c) Full mobile friendly 
			d) Bigdata / Data Science / AI support
			e) Embedding possible [you can keep PBI reports / dashboards in facebook, twitter etc...]
					Websites / Blogs / Portal
			f) End-End BI Process in single application [Power BI Desktop]
				Desktop: Set of graphical operations performing area
			etc...


			Announced: July 2013
			Versions: No versions, we have monthly updates
			Monthly updates:
				a) To capture market
				b) To integrate / add / enhance support according to the changing IT environment

				July 2013-July-2022

--------------
	MSBI -On-premise component: A suite with 3 major tools to perform end-end operations  [Latest support cloud]
		On-Premise Data Engineering + On-Premise Reporting possible
	
	Power BI: 
		Cloud and On-Premise end-end BI Operations supportive service / applications.
		Note: We don't have Data Engineering

	Azure BI: This name not available, if you work on couple of BI components in the azure, then it is Azure BI.
		Mostly for Data Engineering 
		a) Data Extract, Transform, Load [ ADF: Azure Data Factory]
		b) Data Storage [ Synapse / Snow Flake / Data Lake / Databricks etc.]
		c) Data Manage and Analysis: Synapse Analytics...
		etc.		
		Note: No reporting in Azure, hence we need to go for Power BI.


	Current Real-time Projects:

	a) New and specific subject are data applications using Power BI for end-end BI operations
	b) Existing BI Projects using Power BI for Reporting only.
		MSBI+Power BI
		Azure BI+Power BI
		Informatica +Power BI
		Datastage+ Power BI


Current task:
		Objective: How easily we can convert normal data into decision making data using Power Bi Desktop
		a) Download and install Power BI Desktop
		b) I will extract business data
		c) I will transform business data [as it is not column by column]
		d) I will go for visualization [visuals in the report]
		e) Saving the Power BI Desktop Document [.pbix]
		Note: In the end-end process we are not doing modeling today
		         Store, manage, and share to customers also not showing...[Service, Server]
